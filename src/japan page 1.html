        <h5 class="w3-center">Genral information</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">Japan, officially the Empire of Japan, consists of approximately three thousand islands, and
          four of them are of great importance in addition to their large area, which are the islands of Kyushu,
          Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido. The Republic of Japan is located in the far east of the Earth, and the country
          is considered mountainous due to the spread of mountains over areas greater than 70% of its total area, while
          the plains occupy an area estimated at 30% and are limited to major cities.</p>
        <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Japan takes the city of Tokyo as its capital, and this city is
          considered the most important among the cities of Japan. The area of Japan extends to more than seven hundred
          and seventy-eight thousand square kilometers, as this area is considered twice the area of Britain one and a
          half times, and its islands extend from the north of the country and end in the south and reach... The area
          occupied by the islands is about 3,000 km2.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">japan has a fascinating and multifaceted culture; on the one hand it is steeped in the
          deepest of traditions dating back thousands of years; on the other it is a society in a continual state of
          rapid flux, with continually shifting fads and fashions and technological development that constantly pushes
          back the boundaries of the possible. This is part of what makes it such a fascinating country to visit.</p>

          <p class="w3-large">99.2% of people in Japan have Japanese as their first language. There are still a few
            lesser-spoken languages across the islands, including: Amami, Kyukyu, Kikai and Miyako. The Ainu language
            (spoken in Hokkaido) is critically endangered as a language, and only 15 people identified as speaking in in
            the late 1990s. Korean is spoken by 0.5% Population and Chinese about 0.2%. Some people may speak English in
            the major cities but itâ€™s not a given.</p>

          <p class="w3-large">Many visitors to Japan limit their sightseeing activities to the country's heavily
            urbanized areas between Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima. As a result, many return home with a hardened
            misconception that Japan is one large, densely populated megacity. In fact, however, over two thirds of
            Japan are covered by forested mountains and hills, compared to less than ten percent residential and
            industrial land.
          </p>
          <p class="w3-hide-medium">The Japanese archipelago stretches nearly 3000 kilometers from north to south,
            allowing visitors to experience a wide range of natural sights from the drift ice in the seas off Hokkaido
            to the mangrove jungles in Okinawa. In between, there are majestic volcanoes, breathtaking coastlines and
            vast forests inhabited by monkeys, bears, deer, cranes and other wildlife. Places of particular natural
            beauty are protected as national parks and world heritage sites.
            Japan has a rich and diverse natural wildlife including a variety of endemic animal and plant species which
            are, in some cases, extremely rare. A number of Japan's other creatures such as the Blakiston's Fish Owl and
            the Japanese Crested Ibis are also highly endangered and in need of strict conservation and protection.
