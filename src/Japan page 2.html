      <p class="w3-large">The Nakagin Capsule Tower Building, designed by the late Kisho Kurokawa (1934-2007), is a representative work of the Japanese architectural movement called 'Metabolism'. It was built with the idea that by replacing capsules, the building would carry out a form of metabolism; however, in the succeeding 46 years, no capsules were ever replaced.
        The building is comprised of two interconnected concrete towers, to which 140 capsule apartments were individually connected by high-tension bolts so that they could be easily replaced as they aged, putting into practice the Metabolist idea that buildings should be renewable.</p>

        <h5 class="w3-center">It's A Man's Island</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">Okinoshima Island was one of five historic and culturally significant sites in the region nominated for UNESCO status. But while the others have been set aside for further scrutiny, this ancient isle remains in the running thanks to its archaeological significance. More than 120,000 treasures and religious artifacts have been uncovered here.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">The entire island is actually the Munakata Taisha Okitsu-gū, one of three sacred shrines honoring the three Munakata goddesses. These daughters of Amaterasu are the guardians of the ship route from Japan up through the Korean Peninsula, near where Okinoshima is situated.The whole of Okinoshima Island is viewed as sacred land. Men not only have to go through a cleansing ritual before entering, but women are not allowed to set foot on it at all.</p>
        <p class="w3-large">Supporters believe that the ancient religious traditions banning women must be respected. But no one can pinpoint exactly what these traditions that have led to the ban on women, here and on Okinoshima Island, might be. According to Shinto creationist belief, it was the Sun Goddess Amaterasu who gave life to the world and to whom the Emperor is directly descended.</p>

            <p class="w3-large">Niigata prefecture’s Kiyotsu Gorge is a massive natural marvel with volcanic columns, called columnar jointing, overlooking a dramatic river view. After the walking trails were deemed unsafe and closed to the public in 1988, Ma Yansong and the MAD Architects team built the Tunnel of Light, a 750m-long tunnel leading out to the gorge, so visitors can safely view its panoramic beauty. </p>

                <p class="w3-large">Chinoike Jigoku, also known as the "Blood Pond Hell," is a famous hot spring located in Beppu, Japan. It is one of the several unique hot springs in the region, which is renowned for its many geothermal phenomena.
                </p>
                <p class="w3-large">Chinoike Jigoku gets its name from its strikingly red color, which resembles blood. The vibrant hue is caused by the high iron content and mineral deposits present in the hot spring. The water in Chinoike Jigoku is extremely hot, with temperatures reaching up to 78 degrees Celsius (172 degrees Fahrenheit).
                </p>
                <p class="w3-large">Apart from its impressive appearance, Chinoike Jigoku is also known for its therapeutic properties. The hot spring contains various minerals that are said to have healing benefits for skin ailments and other health conditions. However, due to its high temperature, it is not suitable for bathing.
