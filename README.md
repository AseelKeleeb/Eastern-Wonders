# Eastern Wonders
Welcome to Eastern Wonders, an interactive website designed to transport you to the enchanting realms of Japan, Thailand, Korea, and China. This immersive platform offers a captivating digital journey, exploring the unique attractions and hidden gems of these East Asian countries.

Developed as part of the Internet Applications course at Umm Al-Qura University (UQU), Eastern Wonders was inspired by our team’s shared dream of traveling the world. We believe the world is vast, beautiful, and filled with unique and extraordinary places to explore. However, covering the entire world in one website proved challenging, so we decided to focus on our own beautiful continent: Asia. While many websites highlight the well-known attractions of America and Europe—from New York to Paris and London—we wanted to showcase the hidden treasures of Asia, particularly East Asia, which often go unnoticed. Eastern Wonders was created to fill that gap, offering users a chance to experience and explore East Asia’s beauty, culture, and extraordinary attractions as if they were traveling there themselves.

Come and join our journey as we travel through East Asia together, exploring the stunning architecture, vibrant cultures, and breathtaking natural landscapes. Let Eastern Wonders guide you through the hidden gems of this captivating region, offering a virtual experience that feels like a real adventure.

### Technical Details
**HTML** was used to structure the website’s content, with each team member contributing equally to creating the required sections. Initially, the focus was on ensuring that the pages were well-structured and consistent, without the use of CSS, to provide a clear foundation before adding design elements.

For **CSS**, a pre-designed template was sourced online to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the website. The team customized this template to align with the project's goals, creating a cohesive and visually appealing experience for users while maintaining simplicity and ease of navigation.

**JavaScript** played a key role in adding interactivity to the website. A slideshow feature was integrated into the **Home Page**, where images representing China, Japan, Thailand, and Korea are displayed. Each image in the slideshow is clickable and links to a separate page dedicated to the respective country. This allows users to start their virtual tour by exploring China, followed by Japan, Thailand, and South Korea.

For each country, there are two pages: the first page provides general information about the country, including sections such as **About**, **Culture and Society**, **Language**, **Nature and Wildlife**, **Strange Attractions**, and a **Conclusion**. The conclusion section of each page contains a button that encourages users to move to the next page, continuing their virtual tour. The second page highlights some of the extraordinary attractions in that specific country, showcasing its most unique and fascinating destinations.

The flow from one country to the next is seamless, guiding users through China, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea in an engaging manner, with media including images and videos that highlight the beauty and uniqueness of each country. After completing the tour, users can take an interactive quiz to test their knowledge of the countries they’ve explored. The quiz helps solidify the information learned throughout the tour and makes the experience more interactive.

Once the quiz is completed, users can navigate to the **Evaluation Page** using the navigation bar. This page allows users to rate their experience exploring the countries by selecting a star rating. This combination of slideshow navigation, quizzes, and the star rating evaluation page, powered by **JavaScript**, creates a dynamic and engaging user experience throughout the website.

The project was developed using Visual Studio Code, which served as the primary development environment. This tool allowed the team to efficiently manage and collaborate on the codebase throughout the project's lifecycle.

To summarize, the website consists of a total of 11 pages, which are as follows:

**1. Home Page:**
> The introductory page with a slideshow linking to the respective country pages.

**2. Introduction to China Page:**
> General information about China, including sections such as About, Culture and Society, Language, Nature and Wildlife, Strange Attractions, and a Conclusion.

### Limitations
While we aimed for comprehensive functionality, time constraints, and project requirements limited the implementation of some advanced features, such as designing and connecting a database to our website. Future enhancements could include more interactive quizzes, improved user feedback systems, additional animations using JavaScript, and the design and integration of a database to store user data and feedback more efficiently.
